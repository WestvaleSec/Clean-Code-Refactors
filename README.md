# ðŸ§¹ Clean Code Refactors

A collection of refactoring exercises, katas, and experiments designed to strengthen my understanding of **clean code**, **SOLID principles**, and **software craftsmanship** in C#.

Each exercise begins with intentionally messy, unstructured, or inefficient code and is refactored into something cleaner, simpler, and easier to maintain â€” while preserving functionality.

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

This repository serves as my **code-cleaning playground**, where I practice:
- Identifying and correcting **code smells**
- Applying **refactoring techniques** from *Clean Code* and *Refactoring (Fowler)*
- Maintaining readability and testability
- Adhering to the **SOLID principles**
- Transforming procedural, rigid code into modular, reusable design

## ðŸ§© Example Format for Each Exercise

<pre>
Long_Method/
â”œâ”€â”€ Before.cs     # Original unrefined code
â”œâ”€â”€ After.cs      # Clean, refactored version
â””â”€â”€ Notes.md      # What was changed, why, and what improved
</pre>

Example `Notes.md`:
```markdown
### ðŸ§  Problem
This class contains a single, 120-line method with multiple responsibilities.

### ðŸ”§ Refactoring
- Extracted smaller private methods for logical chunks.
- Introduced early returns for clarity.
- Improved naming consistency.

### âœ… Result
Reduced complexity, improved readability, easier to unit test.

```
